                  We will not be liable or responsible to pay the amount for incorrect fund transfer. The customer will be held accountable for the complete information shared by him. Refund credits will be issued only after when a product is received at the warehouse. The process of refund will be initiated after receiving the product and might take around 7 business working days for the amount to reflect in your bank account. At the time of returning the order, make sure the seal of the item is not broken or damaged before handing it over to the courier. It will be good to use separate packets for items to keep it protected and safe.
